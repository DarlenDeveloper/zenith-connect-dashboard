   - Create a simple sine wave tone
   - Export as MP3
   - Save to this directory as "notification.mp3"

2. Download free notification sounds from:

3. Generate a simple notification sound using Text-to-Speech:
   - Use a TTS service to say "Notification"
   - Save the audio as MP3
   - Place the file in this directory

4. Quick test MP3 file creation using ffmpeg (if available):
   ```bash
   # Create a simple notification sound using ffmpeg
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=700:duration=0.5" notification.mp3
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=900:duration=0.5" success.mp3
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=500:duration=0.5" error.mp3
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=800:duration=0.5" info.mp3
   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "sine=frequency=600:duration=0.5" warning.mp3
   ```

Once you have created or downloaded your notification sounds, place them in this directory with the following names:
- notification.mp3 (default)
- success.mp3
- error.mp3
- info.mp3
